Existing scripts
----------------
Note: the scripts of Matthias Cuntz use the Python library cablepop.
      Add this scripts directory to your PYTHONPATH if you do not run
      from the scripts directory, e.g. in the script directory
          export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${PWD}


# Prepare input

create_landmask.py
    Generate global landmask file from a list of lat,lon tupels in a file.
    Files are hardcoded in script.
create_latlon_land.py
    Generate a number of random lat,lon points. Same as generate_latlonlist.py
    but using variable land (0/1) instead of variable iveg (1-17).
    Files are hardcoded in script.
generate_latlonlist.py
    Generate a number of random lat,lon points. Same as create_latlon_land.py
    but using variable iveg (1-17) instead of variable land (0/1).
    Files are hardcoded in script.
lnutils.py
    Python utilities used in create_landmask.py.

# Written by Matthias Cuntz.
duplicate_lon.py
    Copies all variables of a single grid cell file into a second (or more)
    grid cell(s) with the same lat/lon.
extract_latlon.py
    Extract a single latitude/longitude point from a netcdf file.
extract_latlon_restart.py
    Generate global landmask from a list of lat,lon tupels, and extract tiles
    from any number of restart files.
set_latlon_land.py
    Sets the land variable of netcdf file to 1 at given latitude/longitude
    points, otherwise 0.


# Run Cable
-----------
compile_cable-pop.sh

    Written by Matthias Cuntz.
reset_restart.bash
    Utility that batch renames restart files.
    Written by Vanessa Haverd.
run_cable-pop.sh
    Full Cable run with biomass spinup, POP, land-use change, etc.
    Written by Matthias Cuntz.
run_cable_site_CNP.py
    Full cable run with spinup at single sites.

compare_two_cable_runs.sh
    Compare restart and output files of two runs performed with
    run_cable-pop.sh.

    or sum_patchcasa.py) to 2D latitude/longitude output
sum_patchcasa.py
    Copy Casa output summing variables weighted with patchfrac.
sum_patchcasa2d.py
