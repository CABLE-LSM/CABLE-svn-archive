# Single sites over which CABLE is run are defined here. Lines NOT starting with 
# a "#" are interpreted by the run script (run.ksh) as meaningful and used as 
# varibles internally (this includes blank/space lines).

# The first meaningful line is the short name of the site used only to name the 
# sub-directory containg output. The second and third meaningful lines are 
# passed to CABLE as arguments. These are the relative paths to the met. data 
# and the pool size.
