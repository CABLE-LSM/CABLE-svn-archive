version of _debug here is different from that in um :

   unit numbers lesss distinctv here
   r_1, i_d defined here
   if timestep==1 commented out there

           read_debug is differentfrom that developed on sshine as merges program ... into same file. comp_dat and plot_dat are different - althouggg not woking anyway, and som decs different.

it looks like my problem has been the bytee size all along
