first ancil changed was in snow_depth. found a discrepancy in fixhdr etc. this is discussed in log
snow_depth has already been done during development

idl routines to re-write ancil for UM w arbitrary number of tiles

nmain.pro call ntiles_ancil w args=
   name of orig. ancil. -> import this 
   new ancil            -> import this
   ntiles     
   netcdf file containing new data -> import this

Ancillaries/Template/rdancil reads data1(length), whereas original code (Allan's) and User Progs. reads data1(disklen).

i think this works in read because points to appropriate start place eveeery time it reads, if it doesn't read overflow values (where disklen > length), this doesn't effect passed data()

so write for tilefrac seems wrong as it uses above discrep. b/n disklen and length also

** so works both ways - but it would be more correct to write data1(disklen)
