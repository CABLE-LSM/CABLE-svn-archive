Web downloadable CABLE "packages" have already been tailored somewhat, according to their description. Email bernard.pak@csiro.au if you have any further requests. These downloabable packages are extracts from the CABLE repository at 
  
   https://access-svn.nci.org.au/svn/cable/branches/test/users/ludi/Aug11/CABLE-test
   
or perhaps a more browser friendly, "trac" link is

   https://access-svn.nci.org.au/trac/cable     (buttons on top right e.g. "Browse source")

NB. both of these, and access to the repository require an NCI account (link).

The structure of the repository follows the standard svn configuration of:
   trunk/
   branches/
   tags/

"trunk/" contains stable versions of CABLE, including official relaease versions and also incremental versions which may or may not appear in the release version. 
"tags/" contains "packages" of CABLE which are significant in some respect. 
These might be released versions, versions coupled with particular data sets etc. 
Web downloadable packages are included in tags/. 
"branches/" is where users will spend most of their time. branches/ has two subdirectories (dev/ and test/) and the following directory tree:
   
   dev/
      --- Share/
               --- e.g._version_A
               --- e.g._version_B
               --- e.g._version_C
      --- users/
               --- you 
               --- me 
               --- somebody_else 

   test/
      --- Share/
               --- e.g._version_A
               --- e.g._version_B
               --- e.g._version_C
      --- users/
               --- you 
               --- me 
               --- somebody_else 

Note that both dev and share have the same directory structure here, which will become clear as we discuss the intended use of the repository. Also note that at this stage it matters NOT that you understand how these steps are implemented. that will come later.  

Firstly, version control (such as subversion) is accepted best practice in every software development environment in the modern world, science being the remaining recess where it does not seem to have penetrated thoroughly. In broad strokes, version control improves software development for three main reasons. 

   1) bookkeeping    -  in the sense that users/developers can compare results confidently. exactly what version it was that produced particular results, where it came from, what differences have been made since and how is it different to another version are 100% known, doccummented, recoverble etc etc.

   2) semi-automatic documentaion 


   3) incremental backups




The intended use of these branches is as follows:

1) Make a copy of some version/ branch ( from the trunk/ or Share/ ) into a branch under your own username.   


As you might have guessed, the data/ directory is what can make a full download quite cumbersome.

If you are already a CABLE user then you might not need this directory at all, however there will be datasets contained within which you mmight If you have never used CABLE before then it might be prudent for you to download at least   


1)




Downloading CABLE from either the website or the repository will give you a CABLE-xxxx directory where "xxxx" corresponds to the particular version description. The following documentation is aimed at your intended usage of CABLE, ranging from:

1) i just wanna run it on single-site (offline).
   
2) i just wanna run CABLE in a global model (online).

3) i need more info, and/or will (perhaps) participate in development.
  
                           
                           AND

   significantly, whether or not you are familiar with CABLE.                                          
   

Preface: 

The contents of the CABLE-xxxx directory which are discussed in further detail later are:

   README   -  this file
   build    -  build CABLE from source code 
   data     -  datasets relevant to CABLE initialization, forcing etc
   docs     -  CABLE documentation  
   lib      -  working directory and pre-built libraries
   scripts  -  useful scripts, including basic tests for CABLE
   src      -  source code
