FLUXES.... 2.0.01 correspond to fluxes written using version 2.0.01 of the code
std...._um .... 388 correspond to fluxes written using revision 388 of the code

BOTH of these should only be considered examples. The output fluxes are VERY sensitive to namelist files etc,
and so weencourage you to use your own
