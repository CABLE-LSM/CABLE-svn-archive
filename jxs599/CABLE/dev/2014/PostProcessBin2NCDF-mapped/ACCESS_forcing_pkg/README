Directory / Package contents
============================
fortran2NCDF_map.pl*
run.sh*
bin/
src/
data/ 


bin/              - contains executables for concatenatng and writing netcdf files. 
                    these can be built in the src/ directory

src/

data/ 
      mapping/    - sym link to your mapping data
      catted/     - once the multiple processor files in mapping/ have been 
                    concatenated they are put here by the script
      ncdf/       - script put output netcdf fields in here
      
      tile_frac/  - an example of a field mapping. restriction at present is that 
                    the field directory had the same basename as the field. 
                    e.g. data for varaible tile_frac recoreded in tile_frac.bin
                    field dir must also be called tile_frac. We have in this directory
                    sym links back to tile_frac.* files in the mapping directory. 
                    In general for the field(s) you want mapped netcdf(s) from dumped 
                    binaries, you should  put each field into a directory like this.

execute run.sh


further work - translate to single python script
