QUICK START
===========

1. Re-configure the makefile in (./build/Make_CABLE-offline).
   By default this is set to Intel fortran compiler on vayu and corresponding netcdf directory.
2. Automated run script in test_offline requires R. (Load R module if necessary) 
2. Go to test_offline/. 
4. Execute ./run.csh.
5. Outputs can be found in the directory ./out/{sitename}/

By default this will run CABLE, and generate example flux plots for the Tumbarumba site. This behaviour is configured in ./test_offline/main.nml and processed by R scripts in ./test_offline/src/.  The namelist ./test_offline/cable.nml is written by ./test_offline/src/CABLE.R .

Additional single site data is available and will be made available in the official release.

===========
===========

if you just want to compile a ./cable executable, then go to the build directory and enter:

        make -f Make_CABLE-offline 

cable is the first "target" in the sequential Makefile so this will work fine.
 
You can clean up the directory at anytime by entering         

        make -f Make_CABLE-offline clean
   
Aside from local changes to source code that might not compile, the only thing stopping the process might be 
that an executable already exists and so nothing is done by make. Simply remove the existing cable executable. 

The executable (cable) requires a namelist (cable.nml) to be in the same directory as the 
executable. An example of this namelist is in the src/ directory and can be written using ./test_offline/src/CABLE.R .
