this is a Share*d* branch for further development of CABLE-JULES prior to returning to UKMO, JULES, repo on puma.
This initial commit message is duplicated from the March2014/README_jhan file which is intended to contain further updates as they transpire.

March2014 branch looks like the root of the JULES repo on puma. 

This branch should be copied to your user branch and checked out from there for development and testing. 
updates will be commited/merged back to March2014 and should be consequently pulled from here as well. 
at junctures this will be exported back over the top of my user branch on the puma repo. for Matt to revise.
